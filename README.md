**Hello World** ðŸ‘‹

I'm just your friendly neighborhood developer. Well, I'm also<br/>
- **a ECE+BME student at Carnegie Mellon**<br/>
- **founder and captain of the [iTeam](https://github.com/cps-innovation-team) @ CPS**<br/>
- **co-founder and CTO of Kairos Trader, LLC**

I'm fluent in `Swift` `Python` `C`, proficient in `JS` `Arduino/C++` and a master at Stack Overflow.

Feel free to reach out to me at [rahimmalik@cmu.edu](mailto:rahimmalik@cmu.edu) before AI takes our jobs.


*/\* Some of my coolest projects are closed source for IP reasons, so while I can't share code, I'd be happy to explain what went into the tech stack and codebase of those products. \*/*
