**Hello World** ðŸ‘‹

I'm just your friendly neighborhood developer. Well, I'm also<br/>
- **a ECE+BME student at Carnegie Mellon**<br/>
- **founder of the [Innovation Team](https://github.com/cps-innovation-team) @ CPS**<br/>
- **member of the [Hacker Fab](https://docs.hackerfab.org/hacker-fab-space) @ CMU**
- **avionics/mechanical on [Carnegie Mellon Rocket Command](https://jefferyjohn.github.io/rocket/)**

I'm fluent in `Swift` `Python` `C`, familiar with `Arduino/C++` `JS` `MATLAB` `R` `x84-64`, and a master at Stack Overflow. I'm also in the process of putting my `CAD` and `PCB` stuff on here.

Feel free to reach out to me at [rahimmalik@cmu.edu](mailto:rahimmalik@cmu.edu) before AI takes our jobs.
