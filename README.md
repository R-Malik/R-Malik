**Hello World** 👋

I'm just your friendly neighborhood developer, and now student of ECE+BME at Carnegie Mellon. I'm fluent in Swift, proficient in JS, learning Python, and a master of Stack Overflow. Feel free to reach out to me at [rahimmalik@cmu.edu](mailto:rahimmalik@cmu.edu) before AI takes your job.
